# Employee Database using MySQL

This is a README file for an employee database built using MySQL. The database allows you to store and manage information about employees in your organization. This README will provide you with instructions on how to set up and use the employee database.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the employee database, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Open package.json file to view dependencies
Use npm i to install dependencies.

MySQL2
Node.js
Inquirer
Express.js
A terminal (I use gitbash)

To start use the terminal to enter the following:
mysql -u root -p
source schema.sql;
source seeds.sql;
exit

In terminal to start employee database menu:
enter 'node index.js'
crtl c to exit or use 'exit menu' menu option

## Database Usage
You can use this database to add and update employee information. 

I hope to add delete functions later on.
